# Bike-Sharing Project

> A bike-sharing system allows individuals to rent bikes for short periods, either for a fee or for free. Users can typically pick up a bike from a dock, which is often automated. After entering payment details, the system unlocks the bike, and users can return it to another dock in the same network.
